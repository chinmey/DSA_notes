How to identify a recursive problem ? 

Any  problem in which we have choices and we need to make decisions that is recusion . Ex generate all substring for "ab" {"", "a", "b", "ab"}
At each index we have a choice to take it or not this is why this is a recursive problem.

Our decisions taken are represented using a tree that is called recursive tree which is basic for each problem. Technique used here is I/P-O/P (Aditya)
initial input is "ab" and o/p is "" as we reach end of input we get our answers, each branch is based on decision taken by us

If we are not able to think directly using choices we need to look at alternative way of thinking (Base condition - Hypothesis - induction). It relies on 
making input smaller. Example is print 1 to N using recusion. This is about making Hypothesis/Faith in a function on a smaller problem.
Example let us say Solve(n) print 1--> n , let us have faith that Solve(n-1) --> prints 1 --> n-1 than if we just print n (induction we are done)
