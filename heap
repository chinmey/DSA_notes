K + smallest/close -- max heap 
K + largest/top -- min heap

Get Kth largest number --> use minHeap 

Give k most frequent elements --> take a map count frequecy of all element , take a heap enter number and frequecy as pair in it and use custom comparator
class with frequecy

Minimise cost with rope addition 
Put all numbers in heap , pick 2 at top add put addition back in heap and so on 

Median of running stream/sorted array
Inituition is let minH handle large elements and maxH handle small elements their tops give Median
Always ensure diff between heap size is at max one to ensure they handle correct size parts

Merge k sorted array/lists
put list head in heap , keep on popping from top adding to answer and pushing next element from  array/linked list from which top was

Reorganise string
Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

1. Count Character Frequencies:
Create a frequency map (um) to count occurrences of each character in the string s.
2. Initialize a Max Heap:
Use a priority queue (max heap) to store character-frequency pairs, ensuring that characters with the highest frequencies are prioritized.
3. Construct the Output String:
Continuously pop the two characters with the highest frequencies from the heap and append them to the output string.
 If their frequency is greater than zero after appending, push them back into the heap.
4. Handle Remaining Characters:
If there's one character left in the heap, check its frequency. If it's 1, append it to the output. If it's greater than 1, return an empty string as 
itâ€™s impossible to arrange without adjacent duplicates.


Minimum cost to hire 'k' workers

Sort Workers:

Sort the workers based on their wage-to-quality rati
This ensures that we consider the cheapest options first.
Use a Min-Heap:

Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the qualities of the workers we are considering hiring.
Calculate Costs:

Iterate through the sorted workers:
Add the current worker's quality to the min-heap.
If the size of the heap exceeds k, remove the worker with the highest quality (since we want the k lowest quality workers for minimum cost).
If the size of the heap is exactly k, calculate the cost to hire these k workers based on the current worker's wage-to-quality ratio.
Return Minimum Cost:


How does Heap sort work ?


Take unsorted array convert it to max heap , the top number is maximum of array remove it (place it at last) remake a heap and go on 

Heap sort is inplace takes no extra space , its unstable that similar element can looose their starting position


Leetcode 1383. Maximum performance of team 

You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the ith engineer respectively.

Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.

The performance of a team is the sum of its engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among its engineers.

Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: 
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.


so our answer is contribution of effienciency and sum of speed and both can vary , so we need to make one of them constant so we can optimize it is easier 
to make effieciency constant 

Sort enginners by thier effienciency, by storing (effienciency, speed)

now go thru array and for all i try and select other enginners with higher speed it would be true since we would always be selecting one from lower efficiency

 int maxPerformance(int n, vector<int>& speed, vector<int>& efficiency, int k) {
        
        vector<pair<int,int>> v(n);

        long long maxPerf = 0, sum = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            int spd = speed[i];
            int efc = efficiency[i];
            v[i] = {efc, spd};
        }

        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> q;

        sort(v.rbegin(), v.rend());

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)	{
            sum += v[i].second;
            q.push(v[i].second);
            if(q.size() > k) {
                sum -= q.top();
                q.pop();
            }
            long curr = sum *v[i].first;
            if(maxPerf < curr) {
                maxPerf = curr;
            }
        }

        long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        return maxPerf%MOD;
