Number of components in a graph (just see how many DFS are needed to traverse each node)

void DFS(vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<bool> &vis, int start) {
        vis[start] = true;

        for(int x : adj[start]) {
            if(!vis[x]) DFS(adj, vis, x);
        }
    }
    int numProvinces(vector<vector<int>> adj, int V) {

Again we have to count no of DFS needed , take neighbor as edges 


For shortest paths in unweighted graphs we need to rely on BFS and not DFS

BFS explores the graph level by level, meaning it visits all nodes at distance 1 from the source before visiting nodes at distance 2, and so on. 
This makes BFS ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because the first time BFS reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to 
that node.


First kind of shortest path is finding shortest distance from S and D with some obstacles (https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)
Single Source


int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();

        int m = grid[0].size();

        if(grid[0][0] || grid[n-1][m-1]) return -1;

        vector<vector<bool>> vis(n, vector<bool>(m, false));

        int dx[]={0,0,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1};
        int dy[]={-1,1,0,1,-1,0,1,-1};

        queue<pair<int,int>> q;

        q.push({0,0});
        vis[0][0] = true;
        q.push({-1,-1}); // Helps us deduce which levels we are at

        int ans = 1;

        while(!q.empty()) {
           pair<int,int> p = q.front();
           q.pop();

           if(p.first == -1 && p.second == -1) {
              ans++;
              if(!q.empty()) {
                q.push({-1,-1});
              }
           } else {
            if(p.first == n-1 && p.second == m-1) return ans;

            for(int i = 0; i<8; i++) {
                int x = p.first + dx[i];
                int y = p.second + dy[i];

                if(x >= 0 && x < n && y>=0 && y<n && !vis[x][y] && !grid[x][y]) {
                    q.push({x, y});
                    vis[x][y] = true;
                }
            }
           }
        }

        return -1;

Second common type is when in a matrix we only have (S and D) and we are asked to convert D into S in shortest time (ex Rotten Oranges) 
Multi Source

In this we put all of Source in Matrix than we go level by level and populate D 

*** imp : Identify the cells (states) that are already in the target condition or cannot be changed based on the problem constraints, these are put in queue ***

Example problem (Surrond cell : https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/) 

The key initution is not around flipping 0s but finding out which 0s should be protected (so traverse boundary and push all 0s to queue) Do BFS and 
protect the 0s reachable from here (flip rest of the zeroes)


Third common type is Single Source problem with obstacles where we have ability to break obstacles (https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/description/)


The basic idea of BFS/DFS is we never visit the same cell again. In case of shortest paths this is important to ensure we dont visit same path again.
However addition of 'k' subpowers make it different we can visit a already visited path provided we have more value of 'k' than earlier visitor 
this is because since we have more 'k' we have better chance of breaking a obstacles and finding a new smallest path

he key insight here is to treat each possible state (x, y, d) as part of the BFS exploration. Instead of just checking whether a cell can be visited, 
the solution checks if it can be visited with a certain number of remaining obstacle eliminations (d). 
This allows the algorithm to differentiate between paths that may initially appear similar but offer different future potentials depending on how many obstacles remain.

struct State {
    int x, y, remainingK;
};

int shortestPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
    int n = grid.size(), m = grid[0].size();
    if (n == 1 && m == 1) return 0;
    
    vector<vector<int>> vis(n, vector<int>(m, -1));  // track max k remaining at each cell
    queue<State> q;
    q.push({0, 0, k});
    vis[0][0] = k;

    int level = 0;
    int dx[] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
    int dy[] = {1, -1, 0, 0};

        int sz = q.size();
        while (sz-- > 0) {
            State cur = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            // Check if we reached the destination
            if (cur.x == n - 1 && cur.y == m - 1) return level;

                int nextY = cur.y + dy[i];

                if (nextX >= 0 && nextX < n && nextY >= 0 && nextY < m) {
                    
                    if (grid[nextX][nextY] == 0) {  // If the cell is empty
                        if (vis[nextX][nextY] < cur.remainingK) {
                            vis[nextX][nextY] = cur.remainingK;
                            q.push({nextX, nextY, cur.remainingK});
                        }
                    } else if (grid[nextX][nextY] == 1 && cur.remainingK > 0) {  // If it's an obstacle and we can eliminate it
                        if (vis[nextX][nextY] < cur.remainingK - 1) {
                            vis[nextX][nextY] = cur.remainingK - 1;
                            q.push({nextX, nextY, cur.remainingK - 1});
                        }
                    }

0-1 BFS

0-1 BFS is a special case of BFS used in graphs where edge weights are restricted to only two possible values: 0 and 1

In 0-1 BFS, instead of using a regular queue, you use a deque (double-ended queue). The reason for this is that if you encounter an edge with weight 0, 
you want to process it immediately by adding it to the front of the deque (since it’s a "free" move). 
If the edge has weight 1, you add it to the back of the deque (since its a "costly" move).

how it works:

Edges with weight 0 are processed first (pushed to the front of the deque).
Edges with weight 1 are processed later (pushed to the back of the deque).
This allows you to efficiently find the shortest path in O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, by minimizing the cost of traversal using the properties of the deque



Initution of Dijkstra

In BFS we traverse the nodes level by level , essentially since graph is unit weight , we are pushing nodes at levels + 1(weight) however with weighted
graph what we need to do is push the nodes at level + weight


Start from the source node, marking its distance as 0 (since it costs nothing to reach itself).
For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the potential new distance (current_distance + edge_weight). If this distance is smaller than the previously
recorded distance for that neighbor, update the neighbors distance and push it into the priority queue.
Repeat this process until all nodes have been processed or the priority queue is empty.

void dijkstra(int src, const vector<vector<pair<int, int>>& adj, vector<int>& dist) {
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    dist[src] = 0; // Distance to the source is 0
    pq.push({0, src}); // Push the source into the priority queue

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int current_distance = pq.top().first;
        int current_node = pq.top().second;
        pq.pop();

        // If the distance is greater than the recorded distance, skip ensures we don't visit visited nodes
        if (current_distance > dist[current_node]) {
            continue; // or keep a visisted array and if already visisted proceed [prefared]
        }

        // Explore neighbors
        for (const auto& neighbor : adj[current_node]) {
            int neighbor_node = neighbor.first;
            int weight = neighbor.second;

            // Calculate potential distance to neighbor
            int new_distance = current_distance + weight;

            // If found a shorter path to the neighbor
            if (new_distance < dist[neighbor_node]) {
                dist[neighbor_node] = new_distance; // Update distance
                pq.push({new_distance, neighbor_node}); // Push into priority queue
            }
        }
    }
}

Time complexity = O((V+E)logV)

Detect cycle in undirected graph 

o detect a cycle in an undirected graph using DFS, we rely on the parent-child relationship. Here's the key intuition summarized:

Parent Tracking: When visiting a node v from node  u, we track u as the parent of v (i.e., the node that led us to v).

Cycle Detection:

Undirected :: chalte chalte agar visited node pe aagaye jo mera parent nahi h to cycle h 

Directed :: Same logic will not work ex 0---->1<-----2 (we will say cycle h yahan) , basically teen state rakho (unvisted, visiting, visisted)
agar dfs ke dauran visiting mil jaye cycle h

While visiting a neighbor w of the current node v:
If w has not been visited, we continue the DFS by visiting w, marking v as the parent of w.


If w has already been visited and w is not the parent of v, this indicates a back edge (i.e., an edge that connects two nodes that are not directly connected in a parent-child relationship), 
which means a cycle is present

Detecting a cycle in a directed graph using DFS is a bit different from detecting one in an undirected graph. 
The key difference lies in the fact that edges have direction, so we dont need to worry about parent-child relationships as in undirected graphs. 
Instead, we use the concept of node states to detect cycles.

Intuition for Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs Using DFS
Node States:

Unvisited: The node has not been visited yet.
Visiting (or in recursion stack): The node is currently being explored (it is part of the current DFS path).
Visited: The node has been fully explored, meaning all its descendants have been processed, and its no longer part of the current DFS path.
Cycle Detection:

During the DFS traversal, if we encounter a node that is already in the "visiting" state (i.e., its in the recursion stack), it means there is a back edge
 leading to a node that is currently being visited, which indicates a cycle.
Once a node and all its descendants have been fully explored, we mark it as visited (fully processed).


Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, 
vertex u comes before v in the ordering. ---> DO dfs once a node is fully explored put it in stack (answer)


Kahns Algo (BFS way to do Topological sort and detect cycle in directed graph)

Calculate Indegrees: Compute the indegree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex in the graph.

Initialize Queue: Add all vertices with indegree 0 to a queue. These are the vertices with no dependencies, so they can be processed first.

Process Queue: Repeatedly do the following until the queue is empty:
Remove a vertex from the front of the queue and add it to the topological order.
For each of its neighbors, reduce their indegree by 1. If any neighbor’s indegree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

Check for Cycles: If the number of processed nodes is equal to the number of vertices, a valid topological sort exists. 
Otherwise, the graph contains a cycle (since there are nodes with non-zero indegree left).



Union Find and the initution behind same (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1T4AB8xBcw)


Let say we are given a graph and we get only two type of query in it (add edge between 2vertices ) and (find out if 2 vertice are in same component)


1st approach : make a adjanceny matrix out of graph than add edge is O(1) and to say if 2 vertex is in same component do dfs from either O(N)
we want to imporve on second 

2nd approach : Maintain a root-array ex  : 1 1 1 1 5 5


1 ----2 ----3        5----6 
      ----4  

Now whenever second type of query comes just check if roots are same , however if we are asked to add edge we need to traverse whole array and make 
all child have same root ( ex think if 4 --6 edge addition comes )


3rd approach : Maintain a  parent array ex : -1 1 2 2 -1 5 

Now how to find root (keep going till you get parent as -1) , just use this method to solve both kinds O(height) both

To minimise the height we want the tree to be as balanced as possible to ensure it when we join roots always make root with more height the parent

class UnionFind {
private:
    vector<int> parent, rank;

public:
    // Constructor to initialize parent and rank arrays
    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);  // Initialize ranks to 0
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;  // Every element is its own parent initially
        }
    }

    // Find function with path compression
    int find(int node) {
        if (parent[node] != node) {
            parent[node] = find(parent[node]);  // Path compression
        }
        return parent[node];
    }

    // Union function by rank
    void unionByRank(int u, int v) {
        int rootU = find(u);
        int rootV = find(v);

        if (rootU != rootV) {
            if (rank[rootU] > rank[rootV]) {
                parent[rootV] = rootU;  // Attach smaller rank tree under root of higher rank tree
            } else if (rank[rootU] < rank[rootV]) {
                parent[rootU] = rootV;
            } else {
                parent[rootV] = rootU;
                rank[rootU]++;  // Increase rank when both have the same rank
            }
        }
    }
};


Kruskal algo (Minimum Spanning tree)

An MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) of a graph is a subgraph that:

Spans all vertices (i.e., includes every vertex in the original graph).
Is a tree (connected and acyclic).
Has the minimum possible total edge weight, compared to all other spanning trees of the graph.


How can we use Union by Rank to find the MST?
Union by Rank (with Path Compression) can be applied to Kruskals Algorithm, which is a popular algorithm for finding the MST of a graph. 
The algorithm works as follows:

Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weights.
Initialize a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure to keep track of which vertices are in which connected components.
Iterate over the sorted edges, and for each edge, check if its two vertices are in different connected components (using the find function).
If they are in different components, add the edge to the MST and union the two components.
Continue this process until you have added exactly V-1 edges (where V is the number of vertices).

struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(Edge const& other) {
        return weight < other.weight;  // Sort by ascending edge weight
    }
};

for (Edge edge : edges) {
        if (uf.find(edge.u) != uf.find(edge.v)) {  // If u and v are in different components
            uf.unionByRank(edge.u, edge.v);        // Union the components
            mst_weight += edge.weight;             // Add the edge weight to the total MST weight
            mst.push_back(edge);                   // Include this edge in the MST
        }
    }


Cycle detection in Undirected graph (using Union-Find)

Union-Find works for undirected graphs because it efficiently tracks the connected components and allows you to check if adding an edge forms a cycle. 
Here's how:

Cycle Detection in an Undirected Graph:
Every time you add an edge (say between nodes u and v), you check if both nodes u and v already belong to the same connected component 
(i.e., if they have the same root in the Union-Find structure).
If u and v are already connected (i.e., they have the same root), then adding the edge would form a cycle.
If they are not connected (i.e., they have different roots), you union them, merging their components.


Bipartite Graph 

A graph is called Bipartite if we can color it using only 2 colors such that no 2 adjacent vertex are colored same. 

A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd-length cycles. This is because an odd cycle cannot be 2-colored.

This can be found using DFS or BFS
bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int n) {
    vector<int> color(n, -1); // -1 indicates unvisited
    
    // Helper DFS function
    bool dfs(int node, int col, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& color) {
        // Color the current node
        color[node] = col;
        
        // Visit all the adjacent vertices
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (color[neighbor] == -1) {
                // Recursively visit the neighbor with opposite color
                if (!dfs(neighbor, 1 - col, adj, color)) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if (color[neighbor] == color[node]) {
                // If the neighbor has the same color, the graph is not bipartite
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Start DFS from every unvisited node (for disconnected graphs)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (color[i] == -1) {
            if (!dfs(i, 0, adj, color)) {
                return false;  // Graph is not bipartite
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;  // Graph is bipartite
}

It takes the number of vertices n, a vector of edges edges, and the source node src.
First, it initializes the distance to all nodes as infinity, except the source node, which is set to 0.
It then performs relaxation of all edges for n−1 iterations.
After n−1 iterations, it checks for negative weight cycles by attempting to relax edges again. 
If an edge can still be relaxed, it means there is a negative weight cycle in the graph

Time Complexity: O(n⋅m), where n vertex m edge

In a simple path (a path that does not visit any vertex more than once), the longest possible path from one vertex to another can have at most 
n−1 edges. This is because there are n−1 edges before reaching its destination (since you cant visit a vertex more than once in a simple path)


Strongly Connected Components (Connected Components of directed graphs)

A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph in a directed graph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the same component. 
In other words, for every pair of vertices u and v in an SCC, there exists a path from u to v and a path from v to u.

Kosaraju’s Algorithm (Two Passes):
First pass (DFS on original graph):

Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the original graph and store the vertices in a stack based on their finishing times (i.e., vertices with the latest finish time are pushed last).
Second pass (DFS on reversed graph):

Reverse the directions of all edges to form the transpose of the graph.
Now, pop vertices one by one from the stack and perform DFS on the transposed graph. Each DFS will explore a distinct SCC.

    // Function to perform the first DFS and push nodes to the stack based on finish times.

                dfs1(neighbor, adj, visited, st);
            }
        }
        
        // After visiting all reachable vertices, push the node to the stack.
        st.push(node);
    }

    // Function to perform the second DFS on the transposed (reversed) graph.
    void dfs2(int node, vector<vector<int>>& transpose, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[node] = true;

        for (int neighbor : transpose[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs2(neighbor, transpose, visited);
            }

        }

        // Step 3: Perform DFS on the reversed graph in the order defined by the stack.
        fill(visited.begin(), visited.end(), false);  // Reset visited array for the second DFS pass.
